# ESM-2 Model with Adapter Tuning and Prompt Tuning

## Overview
The ESM-2 is a SOTA general-purpose protein language model. 
designed to predict structure, function and other protein properties directly from individual sequences. 
This README.md file provides information and guidelines for using the ESM-2 model with Adapter Tuning and Prompt Tuning.

## Model Description
- **ESM-2**: The ESM-2 model is built upon the Transformer architecture, known for its effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks.
- **Adapter Tuning**: Adapter Tuning is a technique used to fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks while minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Prompt Tuning is a method to fine-tune pre-trained language models using natural language prompts, which allows for more controlled fine-tuning and adaptation to specific tasks.
